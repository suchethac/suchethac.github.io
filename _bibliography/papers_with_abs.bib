     abstract = "{Galaxies reside within dark matter halos, but their properties are
        influenced not only by their halo properties but also by the
        surrounding environment. We construct an interpretable neural
        network framework to characterize the surrounding environment of
        galaxies and investigate the extent to which their properties
        are affected by neighboring galaxies in IllustrisTNG300 data
        ($z=0$). Our models predict galaxy properties (stellar mass and
        star formation rate) given dark matter subhalo properties of
        both host subhalo and of surrounding galaxies, which serve as an
        explainable, flexible galaxy-halo connection model. We find that
        prediction accuracy peaks when incorporating only the nearest
        neighboring galaxy for stellar mass prediction, while star
        formation rate prediction benefits from information from up to
        the third-nearest neighbor. We determine that environmental
        influence follows a clear hierarchical pattern, with the nearest
        neighbor providing the dominant contribution that diminishes
        rapidly with additional neighbors. We confirm that central and
        satellite galaxies, as well as different galaxy categories based
        on mass and star-forming activity, exhibit distinct
        environmental dependencies. Environmental dependence for low-
        mass galaxies ($\log(M_*/M_\odot) < 10$) shows 35-50\%
        environmental contribution compared to just 8-30\% for massive
        centrals, while satellite galaxies experience consistently
        stronger environmental effects than centrals across all
        populations. Furthermore, we find that the most significant
        attribute from neighboring subhalos for predicting target galaxy
        properties is its distance to the nearest neighboring galaxy.
        These quantitative results offer guidance for constructing more
        sophisticated empirical and semi-analytic models of galaxy
        formation that explicitly include environmental dependence as a
        function of galaxy type and mass.}",

While themorphology{\textendash}SFR connection is well studied, the correlation with past star formation activity is not as well understood. To quantify this, we present Katachi (形), an interpretable convolutional neural network framework that learns the connection between the factors regulating star formation in galaxies on different spatial and temporal scales. Katachi is trained on 9904 galaxies at 0.02 < z < 0.1 in the SDSS-IV MaNGA DR17 sample to predict stellar mass (M $_{*}$; root mean square error (RSME) 0.22 dex), current star formation rate (SFR; RMSE 0.31 dex), and half-mass time (t $_{50}$; RMSE 0.23 dex). This information allows us to reconstruct nonparametric SFHs for each galaxy from gri imaging alone. To quantify the morphological features informing the SFH predictions, we use SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). We recover the expected trends of M$_{*}$ governed by the growth of galaxy bulges, as well as those of SFR correlating with spiral arms and other star-forming regions. We also find that the SHAP maps of D4000 are more complex than those of M $_{*}$ and SFR, and that morphology is correlated with t $_{50}$ even at fixed mass and SFR. Katachi serves as a scalable public framework to predict galaxy properties from large imaging surveys including Rubin, Roman, and Euclid, with large data sets of high signal-to-noise ratio imaging across limited photometric bands. *https://github.com/juanpabloalfonzo/Katachi},

        samples as n, we often find a case with n {\ensuremath{\ll}} d.
        Traditionally, such a situation is regarded as ill-posed, and
        there was no choice but to discard most of the information in
        data dimensions to let d < n. The data with n {\ensuremath{\ll}}
        d is referred to as the high-dimensional low sample size
        (HDLSS). To deal with HDLSS problems, a method called high-
        dimensional statistics has rapidly developed in the last decade.
        In this work, we first introduce high-dimensional statistical
        analysis to the astronomical community. We apply two
        representative methods in the high-dimensional statistical
        analysis methods, noise-reduction principal component analysis

        complicated characteristics of the ALMA spectra. Particularly,
        we were able to extract information on the global outflow from

        to spectroscopic survey data, but also to any type of data with
        a small sample size and large dimension.}",

        multidimensional luminosity space is constructed using 11 bands
        that span from far ultraviolet to near-infrared for redshift <
        0.1 galaxies observed with GALEX, SDSS, and UKIDSS. The manifold
        captures the diversity of observed galaxies in terms of stellar-
        dominated emissions and ties the correlations of various
        physical properties to the manifold. We find that two latent
        parameters are sufficient to express 93.2 per cent of the
        variance in the galaxy sample, suggesting that this Galaxy
        Manifold is one of the most efficient representations of
        galaxies. The transformation between the observed luminosities
        and the manifold parameters as an analytic mapping is provided.
        The manifold representation provides accurate (precision = 0.85)
        morphological classifications with a simple linear boundary, and
        galaxy properties can be estimated with minimal scatter (0.12
        and 0.04 dex for star formation rate and stellar mass,
        respectively) by calibrating with the 2D manifold location.
        Under the assumption that the manifold expresses the possible
        parameter space of galaxies, the evolution on the manifold is
        considered. We find that constant and exponentially decreasing
        star formation histories form almost orthogonal modes of
        evolution on the manifold. Through these simple models, we
        understand that the two modes are closely related to gas
        content, which suggests the close relationship of the manifold
        to gas accretion. Lastly, the found manifold suggests a paradigm
        where galaxies are characterized by their mass/scale and

     abstract = "{Faraday tomography offers crucial information on the magnetized
        astronomical objects, such as quasars, galaxies, or galaxy
        clusters, by observing its magnetoionic media. The observed
        linear polarization spectrum is inverse Fourier transformed to
        obtain the Faraday dispersion function (FDF), providing us a
        tomographic distribution of the magnetoionic media along the
        line of sight. However, this transform gives a poor
        reconstruction of the FDF because of the instrument's limited
        wavelength coverage. The current Faraday tomography techniques'
        inability to reliably solve the above inverse problem has
        noticeably plagued cosmic magnetism studies. We propose a new
        algorithm inspired by the well-studied area of signal
        restoration, called the Constraining and Restoring iterative
        Algorithm for Faraday Tomography (CRAFT). This iterative model-
        independent algorithm is computationally inexpensive and only
        requires weak physically motivated assumptions to produce high
        fidelity FDF reconstructions. We demonstrate an application for
        a realistic synthetic model FDF of the Milky Way, where CRAFT
        shows greater potential over other popular model-independent
        techniques. The dependence of observational frequency coverage
        on the various techniques' reconstruction performance is also
        demonstrated for a simpler FDF. CRAFT exhibits improvements even
        over model-dependent techniques (i.e. QU-fitting) by capturing
        complex multiscale features of the FDF amplitude and
        polarization angle variations within a source. The proposed
        approach will be of utmost importance for future cosmic
        magnetism studies, especially with broad-band polarization data
        from the Square Kilometre Array and its precursors. We make the
        CRAFT code publicly available$^{{\textdagger}}$.}",

     abstract = "{Photometric surveys have provided incredible amounts of astronomical
        information in the form of images. However, astronomical images
        often contain artifacts that can critically hinder scientific
        analysis by misrepresenting intensities or contaminating
        catalogs as artificial objects. These affected pixels need to be
        masked and dealt with in any data reduction pipeline. We present
        a flexible, iterative algorithm to recover (unmask) astronomical
        images where some pixels are lacking. We demonstrate the
        application of the method on some intensity calibration source
        images in the CO Multi-line Imaging of Nearby Galaxies (COMING)
        project conducted using the 45 m telescope at Nobeyama Radio
        Observatory. The proposed algorithm restored artifacts due to a
        detector error in the intensity calibration source images. The
        restored images were used to calibrate 11 out of 147 observed
        galaxy maps in the survey. The tests show that the algorithm can
        restore measured intensities at sub 1\% error even for noisy
        images (S/N = 2.4), despite lacking a significant part of the
        image. We present the formulation of the reconstruction
        algorithm, discuss its possibilities and limitations for
        extensions to other astronomical signals, and examine the
        results of the COMING application.}",

     abstract = "{(abridged) The scale of the acoustic oscillation of baryons at the
        baryon-photon decoupling is imprinted on the spatial
        distribution of galaxies in the Universe, known as the baryon
        acoustic oscillation (BAO). The correlation functions and power
        spectrum are used as a central tool for the studies on the BAO
        analysis. In this work, we analyzed the spatial distribution of
        galaxies with a method from the topological data analysis (TDA),
        in order to detect and examine the BAO signal in the galaxy
        distribution. The TDA provides a method to treat various types
        of ``holes'' in point set data, by constructing the persistent
        homology (PH) group from the geometric structure of data points
        and handling the topological information of the dataset. We can
        obtain the information on the size, position, and statistical
        significance of the holes in the data. A particularly strong
        point of the persistent homology is that it can classify the
        holes by their spatial dimension, i.e., a 0-dim separation,
        1-dim loop, 2-dim shell, etc. We first analyzed the simulation
        datasets with and without the baryon physics to examine the
        performance of the PH method. We found that the PH is indeed
        able to detect the BAO signal: simulation data with baryon
        physics present a prominent signal from the BAO, while data
        without baryon physics does not show this signal. Then, we
        applied the PH to a quasar sample at $z <1.0$ from extended
        Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey in Sloan Digital Sky
        Survey Data Release 14. We discovered a characteristic hole (a
        hollow shell) at a scaler $\sim150\ [{\rm Mpc}]$. This exactly
        corresponds to the BAO signature imprinted in the galaxy/quasar
        distribution. We performed this analysis on a small subsample of
        2000 quasars. This clearly demonstrates that the PH analysis is
        very efficient in finding this type of topological structures
        even if the sampling is very sparse.}",

     abstract = "{Observations of the molecular gas in galaxies are vital to understand
        the evolution and star-forming histories of galaxies. However,
        galaxies with molecular gas maps of their whole discs at
        sufficient resolution to distinguish galactic structures are
        severely lacking. Millimeter-wavelength studies at a high
        angular resolution across multiple lines and transitions are
        particularly needed, severely limiting our ability to infer the
        universal properties of molecular gas in galaxies. Hence, we
        conducted a legacy project with the 45 m telescope of the
        Nobeyama Radio Observatory, called the CO Multi-line Imaging of
        Nearby Galaxies (COMING), which simultaneously observed 147
        galaxies with high far-infrared (FIR) flux in $^{12}$CO,
        $^{13}$CO, and C$^{18}$O J = 1-0 lines. The total molecular gas
        mass was derived using the standard CO-to-H$_{2}$ conversion
        factor and found to be positively correlated with the total
        stellar mass derived from the WISE 3.4 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m band
        data. The fraction of the total molecular gas mass to the total
        stellar mass in galaxies does not depend on their Hubble types
        nor the existence of a galactic bar, although when galaxies in
        individual morphological types are investigated separately, the
        fraction seems to decrease with the total stellar mass in early-
        type galaxies and vice versa in late-type galaxies. No
        differences in the distribution of the total molecular gas mass,
        stellar mass, or the total molecular gas to stellar mass ratio
        was observed between barred and non-barred galaxies, which is
        likely the result of our sample selection criteria, in that we
        prioritized observing FIR bright (and thus molecular gas-rich)
        galaxies.}",
