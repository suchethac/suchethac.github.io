**Astrophysicist @ [KIPAC, Stanford University](https://kipac.stanford.edu)**

Suchetha Cooray is a KIPAC Postdoctoral Fellow at Stanford University. His research operates at the intersection of observational data, galaxy formation physics, cosmological theory, and artificial intelligence.

Suchetha is broadly interested in decoding the "cosmic ecosystems" that drive galaxy growth and evolution. His work seeks to reveal the complete lifecycle of galaxies—tracing their origins from density peaks of dark matter, through the complex interaction of their baryonic components, to their eventual cessation of star formation. Galaxy formation presents a profound computational challenge, as physical processes span at least 14 orders of magnitude, from the sub-parsec scales of black hole accretion disks to the vast web of cosmic large-scale structure.

To navigate this complexity, Suchetha employs numerical simulations and machine learning to build statistically robust models of the Universe, connecting the first galaxies revealed by JWST to the mature populations of the present day. As the field enters a transformative decade for precision cosmology, his research focuses on maximizing the scientific insights from upcoming major surveys—including PFS, Euclid, Rubin LSST, SPHEREx, and Roman.

Previously, Suchetha was a [JSPS Postdoctoral Fellow](https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/e-pd/) at the [National Astronomical Observatory of Japan](https://sci.nao.ac.jp/main/en/) and earned his doctorate at [Nagoya University](https://en.nagoya-u.ac.jp).

I earned my doctorate at [Nagoya University](https://en.nagoya-u.ac.jp), where I developed unsupervised machine learning techniques to study galaxy evolution. My master's research focused on solving inverse problems in astrophysics, particularly for imaging surveys and Faraday tomography. -->

<!-- I study the Universe by combining simulations with observations.  -->
<!-- My research
focuses on the physics that govern galaxy formation and evolution. I use numerical simulations and machine learning techniques to model how galaxy populations appear in observations. This approach allows me to explore a high-dimensional parameter space of possible galaxy formation scenarios, providing
insights into everything from the formation of the youngest galaxies to the growth
of massive galaxies and their host dark matter halos. -->

<!-- I study the physics of galaxy formation and cosmology by making cosmological simulations match with observations. My research uses numerical models and machine learning to simulate how galaxy populations appear in observations, which allows me to explore how galaxy populations form and evolve under different physical conditions. This approach reveals statistically rigorous insights into why galaxy populations appear as they are in observations. I am also broadly interested in all AI, machine learning, and statistical methods. -->
