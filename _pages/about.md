*Astrophysicist at [KIPAC, Stanford University](https://kipac.stanford.edu)*

I study the Universe by combining simulations with observations. My research
focuses on the physics that governs galaxy formation and evolution. I use numerical simulations and machine learning techniques to model how galaxy populations appear in observations. This approach allows me to explore a high-dimensional parameter space of possible galaxy formation scenarios, providing
insights into everything from the formation of the youngest galaxies to the growth
of massive galaxies and their host dark matter halos.

I earned my doctorate at [Nagoya University](https://en.nagoya-u.ac.jp), where I
investigated the potential of unsupervised machine learning techniques for
understanding galaxy evolution. Prior to that, I focused on solving inverse
problems in astrophysics, particularly in the context of imaging surveys and
Faraday tomography.
