I study the physics of galaxies in a data-driven way. My research focuses on understanding the complex physics that govern galaxy formation and evolution across a wide range of physical scales. More specifically, I use state-of-the-art simulations and machine learning techniques to forward-model observable properties of galaxies. 
<!-- This allows me to explore a variety of astrophysical processes in a data-driven way, from the formation of the youngest galaxies to the growth of massive dark matter halos that surround galaxies. -->

I earned my doctorate at Nagoya University, where I investigated the potential of unsupervised machine learning techniques for understanding galaxy evolution. Prior to that, I focused on solving inverse problems in astrophysics, particularly in the context of imaging surveys and Faraday tomography.

My CV is <a href = "./Cooray_CV.pdf">here</a>.
