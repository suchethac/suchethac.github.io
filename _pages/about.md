**Astrophysicist at [KIPAC, Stanford University](https://kipac.stanford.edu)**

<!-- I study the Universe by combining simulations with observations.  -->
<!-- My research
focuses on the physics that govern galaxy formation and evolution. I use numerical simulations and machine learning techniques to model how galaxy populations appear in observations. This approach allows me to explore a high-dimensional parameter space of possible galaxy formation scenarios, providing
insights into everything from the formation of the youngest galaxies to the growth
of massive galaxies and their host dark matter halos. -->

I study the galaxy formation and cosmology by making cosmological simulations match with observations. Using numerical models and machine learning techniques, I model how galaxy populations appear in observations, exploring a wide range of galaxy formation scenarios. This approach reveals statistically rigorous insights into why galaxy populations appear as they are in observations. I am also broadly interested in all AI, machine learning, and statistical techniques.

Previously, I was a [JSPS Postdoctoral Fellow](https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/e-pd/) at the [National Astronomical Observatory of Japan](https://sci.nao.ac.jp/main/en/). I earned my doctorate at [Nagoya University](https://en.nagoya-u.ac.jp), where I investigated how unsupervised machine learning techniques can deepen our understanding of galaxy evolution. During my masters, my research focused on solving inverse problems in astrophysics, particularly within the context of imaging surveys and Faraday tomography.
