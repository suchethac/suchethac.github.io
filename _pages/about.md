Astrophysicist at KIPAC, Stanford University

I study the mysteries of the universe through a data-driven approach. My research focuses on the complex physics that governs galaxy formation and evolution. I use state-of-the-art simulations and machine learning techniques to simulate how galaxies appear in observations. This approach allows me to explore diverse astrophysical models that align with observational data, providing insights into everything from the formation of the youngest galaxies to the growth of massive dark matter halos that host galaxies.

I earned my doctorate at Nagoya University, where I investigated the potential of unsupervised machine learning techniques for understanding galaxy evolution. Prior to that, I focused on solving inverse problems in astrophysics, particularly in the context of imaging surveys and Faraday tomography.
