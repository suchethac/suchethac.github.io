**Astrophysicist at [KIPAC, Stanford University](https://kipac.stanford.edu)**

I study the physics of galaxy formation and cosmology using numerical simulations and machine learning. Currently, I focus on simulating galaxy populations across diverse observable quantities, exploring a high-dimensional space of possible formation and evolution scenarios. This approach yields statistically robust insights into the observed Universe! I am also very much interested in all AI, machine learning, and statistical methods.

Previously, I was a [JSPS Postdoctoral Fellow](https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/e-pd/) at the [National Astronomical Observatory of Japan](https://sci.nao.ac.jp/main/en/). I earned my doctorate at [Nagoya University](https://en.nagoya-u.ac.jp), where I developed unsupervised machine learning techniques to study galaxy evolution. My master's research focused on solving inverse problems in astrophysics, particularly for imaging surveys and Faraday tomography.

My CV is <a href="Cooray_CV_2025.pdf">here</a>.

<!-- I study the Universe by combining simulations with observations.  -->
<!-- My research
focuses on the physics that govern galaxy formation and evolution. I use numerical simulations and machine learning techniques to model how galaxy populations appear in observations. This approach allows me to explore a high-dimensional parameter space of possible galaxy formation scenarios, providing
insights into everything from the formation of the youngest galaxies to the growth
of massive galaxies and their host dark matter halos. -->

<!-- I study the physics of galaxy formation and cosmology by making cosmological simulations match with observations. My research uses numerical models and machine learning to simulate how galaxy populations appear in observations, which allows me to explore how galaxy populations form and evolve under different physical conditions. This approach reveals statistically rigorous insights into why galaxy populations appear as they are in observations. I am also broadly interested in all AI, machine learning, and statistical methods. -->
