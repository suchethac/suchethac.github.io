#### Simple Stellar Population Data for Differentiable Stellar Population Synthesis
Simple Stellar Population (SSP) template files for use with the <a href="https://dsps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">Differentiable Stellar Population Synthesis (DSPS)</a> described in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.06830">Hearin et al. (2021)</a>. DSPS enables gradient-based inference through differentiable modeling of galaxy spectral energy distributions. SSPs with varying IMFs, isochrones, stellar spectra, nebular emission, nebula emission properties generated with <a href="https://github.com/cconroy20/fsps">Flexible Stellar Population Synthesis (FSPS)</a> code are provided. 2764 SSP templates in total!

<strong>Access the data files <a href="https://halos.as.arizona.edu/suchethacooray/dsps_ssp/">here</a>. </strong>
