My research focuses on understanding the complex physics that govern galaxy formation and evolution across a wide range of physical scales. More specifically, I use state-of-the-art simulations and machine learning techniques to forward-model observable properties of galaxies. This allows me to explore a variety of astrophysical processes in a data-driven way, from the formation of the youngest galaxies to the growth of massive dark matter halos that surround galaxies.</p> <p>I earned my doctorate at Nagoya University, where I investigated the potential of unsupervised machine learning techniques for understanding galaxy evolution. Prior to that, I focused on solving inverse problems in astrophysics, particularly in the context of imaging surveys and Faraday tomography.</p> <h3 id="recent-updates">Recent Updates</h3> <ul> <li> <p><strong>2024/5/01</strong> Moved to Stanford University as a KIPAC Fellow.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>2024/4/01</strong> Moved to Nagoya University as a postdoctoral researcher.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>2023/4/01</strong> Moved to National Astronomical Observatory of Japan as a Japan Society for Promotion of Science (JSPS) Postdoctoral Fellow.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>2023/3/27</strong> Obtained the Doctor of Science from Nagoya University, Japan!</p> </li> </ul> </body></html>
